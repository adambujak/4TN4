\subsubsection{Resolution}

\textbf{What does the camera resolution show?}

The main camera (wide) is a 50MP camera - indicating that there are 50 million pixels. This is simply a measure of how many RGB measurements are recorded for each photograph.

\subsubsection{Sensor Size}

\textbf{As shown the size of the main camera is 2.44μm while the selfie camera sensor size is 0.8μm. First define the
camera sensor size and the state what is the advantage of having larger sensor size?}

The 2.44
